## Project Overview  
- **Issue**
- JHBMC set a target discharge time of 12:00 pm, yet 92% of patients are discharged after noon, which leads to patient backlog, delayed admissions, and reduced operational efficiency
- **Goal**
- Optimize the hospital discharge process through workflow analysis, stakeholder engagement, and targeted interventions    

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background & Problem Statement
- **Hospital Context**  
- Location: Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center  
- Capacity: 320+ beds  
- Focus area: Patient discharge workflow
- **Challenges**  
- Doctors' late rounds and discharge note delays  
- Nurses' workload and lack of real-time EPIC notifications  
- Pharmacy backlog (100â€“150 prescriptions per day with limited staff)  
- Transportation barriers for patients and families  
- **Problem Statement**  
- 92% of patient can't be discharged before hospital's target discharge time. This project aims to examine each step within the discharge process, identify barriers, and propose improvements to enhance bed availability and patient flow

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methodology  
- **Literature & Policy Review**  
- Reviewed documents and literature provided by Dr. Renee Blanding, including hospital capacity meeting notes and internal surveys 
- This step helped us reframe the broad challenge of optimizing discharge into a clear problem statement 
- **Field Observations & Interviews**  
- Conducted weekly hospital visits for on-site observation  
- Interviewed nurses, doctors, and technicians across the Emergency Department and general wards to understand the practical steps in the discharge workflow  
- Developed a linear discharge process map describing each stage in discharge process  
- **Problem Breakdown**  
- Initially, we Categorized issues by department (ED, Medical, OR) and found overlaps and gaps. Then, we Shifted to categorizing by problem source (hospital end, patient end, outside pharmacy) 
- **Time Study Analysis**  
- Collected and analyzed the duration of each step in the discharge process.  
- Identified 6 major drivers of delay: Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacy, Transportation, Patient Readiness, and Diagnostics. Then we put our focus on 4 resolvable parts.

## Key Takeaways & Impact  
- **Findings**  
- 6 major factors causing delays: Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacy, Transportation, Patient Readiness, Diagnostics.  
- Focused on controllable areas (Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacy, Transportation)  
- **Recommendations**  
- Short-term Solutions 
- 1. Discharge List (save ~96 mins)
  2. Pre-order Drugs (save ~90 mins)
  3.  Notification on EPIC (save ~90 mins)  
- Long-term Solutions  
- 1. AI-assisted Medication Reconciliation
  2. AI-based Estimated Discharge Date Prediction  
- Additional: Incentive Program  
- Recognition and rewards (meal vouchers, goody bags, public acknowledgment)
- For more details, see [Final Report](./Hospital%20Discharge%20Report.pdf)  
- **Impact**  
- Projected 29% reduction in discharge time (from 3:54 PM average to 11:18 AM)  
- Increased stakeholder satisfaction and hospital leadership support  
- Return offer from Vice President Dr. Renee Blanding to continue AI-related recommendations  
- Presented via Poster Session for public at Johns Hopkins Hospital and JHBMC; Final Presentation for all stakeholders
